                    is a company that does in the inter-city parcel delivery but 
                    also in international parcel delivery. We put in relation 
                    travelers who are members of our service who have free mass (Kg) in  
                    wishing to ship their parcel to destinations similar to those 
                    travelers. This allows package senders to save money when 
                    of their sending parcels (the prices defy any concurence), and there are several possible choices. Similarly, 
                    travelers earn money by selling their free mass (Kg), thus cushioning their transportation costs.
